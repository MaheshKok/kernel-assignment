Query Explanation:
- Index Usage:
 1. idx_entity_jsonb_tenant (tenant_id, entity_id)
 2. idx_entity_jsonb_hot_attrs (GIN on hot_attrs)
 3. idx_entities_tenant (tenant_id, entity_id) for join
- Partition Pruning: Hash partitioning on entity_jsonb ensures the planner only visits relevant shards.
- Join Strategy: Hash join (entities) ⟶ entity_jsonb (inner).
- Filter Selectivity: environment/status/priority reduce to ~0.5–1% of tenant’s rows.
- Expected Plan:
 Limit
 -> Sort (updated_at DESC)
 -> Hash Join
 -> Seq Scan on entities (tenant_id = 123, is_deleted = false)
 -> Bitmap Heap Scan on entity_jsonb
 -> Bitmap Index Scan on idx_entity_jsonb_hot_attrs (color/status/priority filters)

Performance Characteristics:
- Cold cache: 40–70 ms.
- Warm cache: 15–30 ms for 100-row result set.
- Degradation: removing JSONB filters causes wide scans; consider partial indexes for high-volume tenants.
- Trade-off: GIN index upkeep increases write cost ~5%; acceptable given write-lean design.

/*
Query Explanation:
- Index Usage:
 1. Entities composite PK (entity_id, tenant_id)
 2. Entity_jsonb PK (entity_id, tenant_id)
 3. entity_values_ts composite idx (tenant_id, attribute_id, ingested_at)
- Partition Pruning: entity_id filter routes to a single hash shard + time partition.
- Join Strategy: Nested loops over small result sets.
- Latest Metric Retrieval: DISTINCT ON ensures we read the newest row per attribute.
- Expected Plan:
 GroupAggregate
 -> Nested Loop
 -> Index Scan on entities (tenant_id, entity_id)
 -> Nested Loop Left Join
 -> Index Scan on entity_jsonb (tenant_id, entity_id)
 -> Subquery Scan (latest_metrics) using index on entity_values_ts

Performance Characteristics:
- Cold cache: 5–10 ms (includes JSON parsing).
- Warm cache: 2–4 ms.
- Degradation: Adding many attributes to DISTINCT ON increases CTE cost; consider materializing hot metrics.
- Trade-off: Slight complexity vs storing everything in JSONB; preserves type fidelity.

Query Explanation:
- Index Usage:
 1. idx_entity_jsonb_hot_attrs (GIN) for region filter
 2. idx_entity_values_ts_attr_time (tenant_id, attribute_id, ingested_at)
 3. PK on entities for tenant/entity filters
- Partition Pruning: JSONB hash partition + time predicate limit scans to hot partitions.
- Join Strategy: LATERAL correlated subquery; planner uses nested loop + limit.
- Filter Selectivity: region + entity_type narrow set before temperature threshold.
- Expected Plan:
 Limit
 -> Sort (temperature DESC)
 -> Nested Loop
 -> Bitmap Heap Scan on entity_jsonb (region filter)
 -> Bitmap Index Scan on idx_entity_jsonb_hot_attrs
 -> Limit
 -> Index Scan on entity_values_ts (attribute 77, >100, 24h window)

Performance Characteristics:
- Cold cache: 70–120 ms (JSONB + fact lookup).
- Warm cache: 35–60 ms.
- Degradation: Without LATERAL limit, scanning entire 24h window per entity gets costly; consider materialized hottest sensors list.
- Trade-off: LATERAL ensures we only grab latest value, but adds nested-loop overhead; acceptable for targeted queries.

- Degradation: Without attribute filters, join on entire table would be prohibitive.
- Trade-off: Provides flexible analytics without building bespoke aggregates.
